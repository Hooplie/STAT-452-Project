# STAT 452 Project - Statistical Learning and Prediction

The goal of this project is to obtain the best prediction possible using techniques and models learned in the course. A csv file given by the professor containing data of p explanatory variables and one response variable is used to train the model. After the model is selected a different csv file containing explanatory variables without the response variable is used for the final prediction. The project is a competition and my prediction score ranked top 5% in the class.
